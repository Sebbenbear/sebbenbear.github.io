title: Learning Networking

I've been helping a network engineer with some automation work, and it made me realise how little I really knew about 
networking. It was just something that other people knew about, but a lot of the terms were pretty unfamiliar to me! <!--break--> I did one networking course at uni, but it taught us mainly how to code in Python, C, and I vaguely remember dealing with sockets.

[Headfirst Networking](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596521561.do) is the first book I picked up, and I got recommended
[INE Routing & Switching Technologies](https://downloads.ine.com/d/ccna-routing-switching-technologies) to go through.

Headfirst Networking, like other books I've picked up from the Headfirst series, is very easy to read and explains concepts in
simple language. It's a little bit dated, but almost all of the concepts still hold. At ~500 pages, it's not particularly 
long either, and I've covered half of the content including doing the exercises in a couple of days. I've picked up bits and 
pieces about networking, but reading this book really makes me feel like I'm filling in all those little knowledge holes, and I feel generally less clueless about how I'd go about fixing a network issue in the future.
