# Problem Solving

After spending lots of money on my education, it's been a joy to discover that I can continue to learn for free on my own 
terms. I'm very fond of online learning. One of my favourite courses was Udacity's "Introduction to Programming." Chapter 10, 
"How to solve problems" was one of the highlights of this course. When you learn to code, you're often not taught how to 
approach a problem systematically. I feel that the earlier you begin to solve problems in this way, the less time and
frustration you'll feel!

## The Problem

To learn a problem solving process, it helps to demonstrate this process with an actual problem.

In this case, let us think about the following problem. Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in
days, compensating for leap days. Assume that the birthday and the current date are correct dates (and no time travel 
is possible).

For example, if you were born 1 January 2012 and the date is currently 2 Jan 2012, you are 1 day old!

We can express this function in the following method stub in Python:

`
days_of_months = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]

def is_leap_year(year):
    pass
`

## What is the first thing we should do to solve a problem like this one?
