I only have 3 more weeks of Recurse Center left as of Monday - how time has flown! I'm had some reflections on how this all began and my experience so far.

I discovered Recurse Centre by watching a video on technical interviews on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8RxkpUvxK0&t=2230) - Moishe Lettvin mentioned this thing called Hacker School, and how "2 months of solid coding will help you get much better at programming". 

When I googled it, the first thing that stood out to me about RC's website was the rainbow coloured nav at the top - it alluded to a diverse and inclusive environment before I'd even scrolled or clicked anywhere. When I browsed over their philosophy and values, poring over phrases such as 'self directed', 'get dramatically better', and 'diverse community', they resonated quite strongly with me. 

I tend to study a fair bit in my own time, but I'm also a social learner and was missing that aspect of university - having passionate people around to bounce ideas off, to learn and teach new and exciting things.

When I saw that RC even had a stipend to cover living costs (RC is based in New York City), it made it all possible, and in September 2017 I decided that I would apply. As part of the application, you need to submit some code based on the suggestions by RC.

I chose Tic Tac Toe because it was scoped well and familiar to me. I coded it up, added some unit tests, and submitted it when I thought it seemed like a reasonable submission - about 3 months later.

RC got in touch with me, then I had a conversational interview with an RC alum. They were interested in knowing what my motivations for attending RC were, and whether I had gained deep knowledge of something. After hearing that I passed that interview, I had a technical interview where I added some functionality to my Tic Tac Toe game. My interviewer requested a change, after which I then reasoned aloud how I would make those changes, and then implemented them. One question that I asked both of my interviewers was how RC benefitted them both personally and professionally, and they had endlessly great things to say about it, which made me even more excited!

I was absolutely delighted when I found out I was accepted, and it made it all very real. The same day that I found out that my application was successful, I discussed it with my partner, who was very supportive about it. I then talked to my workplace, and gave them the options to choose when I would go. I was going to go as a Summer 1, but work preferred that I delay it a bit so I became a Summer 2 instead. They were very supportive and excited for this opportunity as well. I had booked my flights, initial accomodation and said my goodbyes.

When I first saw RC, it had the startupish feel, with lots of contraptions that previous RCers had built around the place - it is evidently a much loved and creative space. RC is moving at the end of my batch, but I'm sure the new space will quickly become very personalised to the RC community.

I did a bunch of things - these are roughly categorised as Individual or Social, depending on whether I spent the majority of time on the project learning with other people or on my own.

## Individual
- started Wes Bos Javascript 30 (learned a lot about ES6 and shiny new things in CSS even!)
- built a simple shell in C
- used Processing (Java) to create an animation of Conway's Game of Life, then used an interaction of that as a design for a box
- ran a Game Jam, during which I created a colourful game of Breakout in Javascript
- analysed my iMessage and social media data using Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas 
- created a Glossary app with React and Firebase
- worked on my personal github pages site (Jekyll)
- wrote some blogs (like this one!)
- worked on a sitemap generator in Python
- paired on a Jupyter Notebook explaining how RSA encryption works
- started implementing an AVL Tree (a binary tree that rebalances itself by rotating nodes on insertion if the subtrees are unbalanced)
- read some academic papers (going to a coffee shop and reading a paper is now one of my favourite things to do!)

## Social
- learned a bit about concurrency and parallelism in Python / generally
- learned about Operating Systems by viewing the Berkeley OS Lectures from 2015
- paired on Conways Game of Life to review how pair programming works
- listened many to technical presentations by RC folks on all sorts of topics
- ran PLP, a daily study group for getting better at solving algorithms and data structures problems
- ran a workshop on Python Iterators and Generators
- there was also heaps of social stuff like playing Overcooked, grabbing coffees, lunches, dinners, watching movies, going to parties, you name it!

It's been a pretty great time so far, and I'm looking forward to making the most of the last quarter of my batch.
Everyone I meet is pretty outstanding in some way or another, and I'm excited to continue to learn even when I get back to Sydney, as Zulip is always buzzing with interesting things and I'm really happy that I'm now part of this incredible community.

If you're interested in learning more about RC, you should check out their site! I would definitely recommend this experience.
