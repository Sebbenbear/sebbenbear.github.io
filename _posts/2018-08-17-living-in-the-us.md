## Stipend

Recurse Centre is amazing, in that they will provide a stipend to people from underrepresented demographics in tech - but it's very important that you recognise what you will need and be able to budget for it.

At time of writing, if you meet their criteria, you can ask stipend up to $7.000 USD. 
I've put together a handy guide to help you figure out what the minimal amount you will need is.

## Accomodation - 12 week batch

I didn't ask for much with my accomodation - all I need is a shower and a bed.
What is important to me is having a room to myself, even if it's really small! I think it's important to have a space that is just for you.

| Location   | Source   | Number of Nights | Total Cost ($USD) | Cost Per Day ($USD) |
|------------|----------|:----------------:|-------------------|---------------------|
| Chinatown  | AirBnB   | 31               | 1,204.25          | 38.85               |
| New Jersey | AirBnB   | 17               | 1,035.43          | 60.91               |
| Brooklyn   | Recurser | 35               | 1,000.00          | 28.57               |
| Total      |          | 83               | 3,239.68          | 42.78               |

Recurser Accomodation: $1000 USD

If you can, live with Recursers.

## Laundry
Costs about $2 per week, so a full batch is $48 USD.
You don't need to use the dryer really, I found that just hanging laundry up around my room worked fairly well.

I find that going to a nice cafe will make this a much more enjoyable time! You can sit in, do a leetcode problem or read an academic paper in the half hour it takes to wash. 

Getting a coffee and snack will cost an extra $7 or so, which is an additional $84 if you do this once a week for 12 weeks.

So laundry days in total will set you back $132 USD.

## Food

Eating out sets you back a far bit, so it's good to go to Trader Joes and get some food that way - this is the cheapest way to get healthy food at least.

I have not had a good experience buying avocados.
