It's been quite a year - I started working at Ericsson Sydney in February. The culture and people there are really awesome - I really look forward to working with these excellent people each day. 

## Managed Services (7 months)

I initially found it challenging when I placed as a Data Analyst when I was expecting to be placed in a software developer role, as there was a greater business need in that area. However, I found ways to apply programming and automation there regardless. Rather than use Excel for all the things, I thought it would be interesting to try using other technologies commonly used in Data Science such as SQL, Jupyter Notebooks, Python/Pandas (choosing Python over R since I thought it would be easier for my coworkers to learn, as well as help people learn to automate other aspects of their work). I talked to my coworkers about trying these, and they were very supportive of it.

I initially started learning [SQL from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197), and work colleagues from other areas of the business were more than happy to help too. We managed to automate a manual report that previously took many hours to do initially, and really helped the team, and while I was in that team I reduced my time on certain tasks down to a fraction of what they would otherwise take, allowing me to spend more time automating new things!

## Customer Adaptation Centre (4 months)

As of 1 September, I moved into the Customer Adaptation Centre for a Solution Architect placement, which is the role I (and the Customer Adaptation Center manager!) initially thought I would be moved into. I found this really interesting but difficult, since there were many meetings about lots of different kinds of complex projects, and it was hard to keep up! I also found that my days just became full of meetings, and I didn't have enough time to work on things. After chatting to my manager, it was agreed that I could put more of my time into a network test automation project, and gain a really solid foundation with Ansible and Python.

Another exciting experience for me was managing a student capstone project that I'd come up with. This was a new challenge for me, since I've never managed anyone before, and I was really worried if I wasn't giving her enough help/too much help. She did exceptionally well, and blew me away with how much she learned! She had barely done any Python to begin with, and towards the end she was confidently speaking to senior managers about the machine learning algorithms she had applied to the data set I gave her. She really enjoyed the experience too, which was brilliant!

## Extras

I did a talk about Ansible at Women Who Code Sydney in December [(presentation)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X_eQzYfjegAI9EaqRovfUUJlHzQR46yMmw7RSOtA-wQ/edit?usp=sharing)

I managed to pay off my student loan, which had steadily been aquiring interest in New Zealand while I've been in Australia. It feels great to not have to worry about that anymore!

My team won the People's Choice Award at SheHacks 2017 with our StyloSheBot chatbot - I'd never won a giant novelty cheque before, it was such a good time! My team was a really amazing group of technically minded women, and we worked together really well.

Conferences I attended included Container Camp, Google Women Techmakers Summit, Oracle Code and Openstack Summit. I gained heaps of exposure to new technologies and met great people!

### 2018 Goals

Give at least one technical presentation to keep my presentation skills up (even though public speaking freaks me out!)

Start giving back to the community more through [Girls Programming Network](https://sites.google.com/site/girlsprogrammingnetwork/)

Blog regularly about technical content, and create tutorials to help others learn.

Create a [Python web app](https://www.fullstackpython.com/)

Complete the [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com/) Java challenges (10% done so far).

Gain more advanced knowledge of Python, including advanced language features and Pythonic ways of programming. I will work through the official Python docs and tutorials to do this.

Gain more knowledge of networking, so I can troubleshoot networking issues. I will use INE and the book Headfirst Networking to get started with this. 

Finish the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/sebbenbear) Front End development certification track (currently 60% done)

Get more comfortable with solving medium-level problems on [Hackerrank](www.hackerrank.com)

Learn more about system design - [Donnemartin's system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) seems like a great place to start, as does [Hired In Tech](https://www.hiredintech.com/system-design/) and [Palantir's blog](http://www.palantir.com/2011/10/how-to-rock-a-systems-design-interview/)

Learn how to develop an app on AWS
