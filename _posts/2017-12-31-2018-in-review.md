### Looking back on 2017

It's been quite a year - I started working at Ericsson in February, and in this time I've managed to:

- Pay off my student loan
- Gain more experience with new technologies

### Goals

- Give at least one technical presentation
- Start giving back to the community more through [Girls Programming Network](https://sites.google.com/site/girlsprogrammingnetwork/)
- Blog regularly about technical content, and create tutorials to help others learn.
- Create a [Python web app](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) using one of the ideas I've had already.
- Complete the [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com/) Java challenges (10% done so far).
- Gain more advanced knowledge of Python, including advanced language features and Pythonic ways of programming. I will work through the official Python docs and tutorials to do this.
- Gain more knowledge of networking, so I can troubleshoot networking issues. I will use INE and the book Headfirst Networking to get started with this. 
- Finish the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/sebbenbear) Front End development certification track (currently 60% done)
- Get more comfortable with solving medium-level problems on [Hackerrank](www.hackerrank.com)
- Learn more about system design - [Donnemartin's system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) seems like a great place to start.
