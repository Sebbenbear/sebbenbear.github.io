  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>I’ve tried out mobile and web development, UX, infrastructure and analytics and automation - so long as it’s solving a problem people need, it makes me happy.</p>
  <p>I enjoy writing code, working with great people and all combinations of these.</p>
  <p>I was born in Ireland, grew up in New Zealand, and am currently based in Sydney, Australia.</p>
  <p>I’m a foodie and enjoy cooking / baking things I’ve never tried before! I also love going for walks in the wilderness, videogames and creating art.</p>
  <p>You can contact me via email, or through any of the media below.</p>
